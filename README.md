# üì¶ IoT-Based Smart Fruit Storage System

**Final Year Project ‚Äî EEE 416, BUET**

This project presents an IoT-enabled smart fruit storage system that automates the control of temperature, humidity, and air quality using embedded sensors and actuators. The system is built using an Arduino Mega for local control and an ESP8266 module for cloud integration via the Arduino IoT Cloud platform.

It is designed to reduce spoilage and maintain optimal storage conditions through environmental sensing, actuator control, and remote monitoring.

## üåê Arduino IoT Cloud Integration

Sensor data and actuator states are transmitted from Arduino Mega to the ESP8266 via Serial1. The ESP8266 publishes this data to the Arduino IoT Cloud, where it is visualized and monitored in real time. Manual override switches are also integrated, allowing remote control of actuators such as the Peltier module and ventilation fan.
